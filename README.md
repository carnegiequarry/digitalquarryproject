# digitalquarryproject
The Digital Quarry Project is an effort to bring the fossils of Dinosaur National Monument's Carnegie Quarry online for researchers and the public.

<strong>What to do</strong><br>
<p>First, check out the main website here: http://www.carnegiequarry.com/
We use WordPress and have volunteers at Dinosaur National Monument working on content. Poke around and you'll learn a bit about Dinosaur National Monument and the fossil quarry it was founded for.</p>

<p>The code-y fun part of the project is here: http://www.carnegiequarry.com/modern-quarry/digital-quarry-all-modern-fossils.php#anchor
This is the Digital Quarry, a tool for researchers and the public to explore the fossils of Carnegie Quarry. </p>

<p>Right now it has very basic functionality and only includes 551 of the fossils that are currently visible to visitors at the Quarry Exhibit Hall in Utah. However, roughly 5000 fossils have been documented from Carnegie Quarry--most of them were excavated and sent to muceums like the Smithsonian, the AMNH and of course the Carnegie Museum. </p>

<p>Our goal is to eventually include all of those 5000 fossils in a rich, interactive online tool that is about three times larger on the page than the current Digital Quarry, and allows users to toggle fossils by taxa, current location, maybe even bone type and year exacavated. The ability to search any of these fields and have bones that match highlight would also be very useful. We're open to toher ideas and suggestions of how to make this more engaging, useful and fun.</p>
