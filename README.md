# digitalquarryproject
The Digital Quarry Project is an effort to bring the fossils of Dinosaur National Monument's Carnegie Quarry online for researchers and the public.

<strong>How to Contribute</strong>
We need to solve some scalability issues. Five thousand fossils each need to have their own informational modal, but making five thousand modals is a sucky idea. How to code one modal that feeds in the right data for the fossil that was clicked on?
